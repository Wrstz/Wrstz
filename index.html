        <h1>What PC should you buy?</h1>

        

        <p>
            The first option and the option that I would advise is the NZXT starter pc. It is 899 dollars although there is a option called the NZXT starter plus that comes with an upgraded gpu and more memory. The specs on the NZXT starter pc include an i5-9400F and a nvidia gtx 1660 super. 
            It has 16gb of 2x8 3200mhz ram and 512 gb storage.It comes with wifi and bluetooth. It also works well with vr games and streaming. If you go for the starter pc plus which is 100 dollars more you will get an upgraded graphics card and storage. Instead of getting the gtx 1660 super it will have the gtx 1660 ti.
            You will also get one terabyte of storage. The starter pc plus will be giving around 100 plus fps in most games at the HIGHEST setting. While with the ordinary starter pc you are guaranteed 80+ fps playing these games at the highest settings. Both come with windows 10.
               
        </p>

            The second option is we build a pc. The cost would be 950$. Its key components are the Ryzen 5 3600 cpu, Corsair vengeance 16 gb 3200mhz ram, 1TB pc ssd with Sata three cables, and a GTX 1660 Super.
 I will list the rest of the components below. The GTX 1660 Super will be able to get 160+ fps in most games on low settings with 100% 3d resolution. 
On games highest settings you can expect 80+ fps most of the time. This pc is probably better than  the starter PC but that is 150$ less expensive. Also if you chose to buy the starter pc plus you will be looking at bassically a better system for a lower price and also windows 10.Hi.
